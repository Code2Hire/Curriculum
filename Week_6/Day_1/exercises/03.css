/* Positioning Styles

Use only CSS to accomplish making the following style changes:
    
    1 - use the 'float' attribute to make the first 2 headlines share a line; give the h1 headline a width of 66% and the sub-headline a width of 33%

    2 - use CSS to make the height of the page 3000px; then use append a <div> tag to the end of the body to create a 20px by 20px box with a background color; position it so that when you scroll down, it stays in the top right corner of the page

    3 - in the first <div> tag with the 3 paragraphs and user-added headline inside, use the 'float' attribute again to create a grid with the 4 equal-width children: the first 2 paragraphs should sit on the first row, with the third paragraph and appended headline on the second row; give the paragraphs background colors of red, yellow, and blue, respectively, and then give the headline a background color of purple

    4 - append another new <div> element after the one created in step 2; make this div full-width, and give it a height of 500px; make the background color purple; add a child div with dimensions 20px by 20px, and using positioning, make the child div sit in the bottom right corner of the parent div element

    5 - use only positioning to shift the last item in the ordered list up 4px and right 8px

             I had the other day in my possession a label bearing the number 3 0 2 5. This got accidentally torn in half, so that 3 0 was on one piece and 2 5 on the other. On looking at these pieces I began to make a calculation, when I discovered this little peculiarity. If we add the 3 0 and the 2 5 together and square the sum we get as the result, the complete original number on the label! Thus, 30 added to 25 is 55, and 55 multiplied by 55 is 3025. Curious, is it not?

             Rules:
             validate that the number entered is 4 characters in length
             find a php function that can determine if a number is an integer
             the function should return a boolean
             if a number is a valid torn number print to the screen XXXX is a valid torn number
             */

             // create a function that verifies if a number is a valid torn number.
             // check all numbers from 1000 - 9999
             // print all numbers that are torn

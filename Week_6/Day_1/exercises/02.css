/* Display Styles

Use only CSS to accomplish making the following style changes:
    
    1 - make the main <h1> headline and <h2> headline sit on the same line together

    2 - add 3 movies to the Nerdy Movies list, and then hide "Star Wars" *without adding a class to the individual list items 

    3 - for the individual paragraphs in the first div, for the first paragraph: make the background yellow when you hover over it;

    4 - append a headline tag (any level besides h1) to the end of the paragraphs in the first div element, and make it sit on same line as text from last paragraph

    5 - give that headline a 1px border, background-color, and padding of at least 10px on left and right sides
